# Credit for rb_tree.py

The red-black tree implemented in rb_tree.py has been modified by me for my purposes from the one in the MIT-licensed "Algos" repository found at https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski/algos.
This repository has implementations for a large number of data structures, but I only needed a red-black tree.

As is required by the MIT license, the original license is included in this directory. In addition, however, I wanted to link to the repository (as done above) and credit the creators.

The project maintainers are listed in their repository's README as being [Avi Aryan](https://github.com/aviaryan) and [Pratyush Singh](https://github.com/singhpratyush). They credit the idea of the repository to [Monal5031](https://github.com/Monal5031).
